\section{Simulation Framework}
The beads- In our system of a chain of beads connected by harmonic springs, the beads represent monomers of a polymer chain.in our setting, these monomers can be thought of as the nucleusomes.
Nucleosome- In Eukaryote cell, the nucleusome packs around 2 meters of DNA material into an accessible package called the nucleusome. It size is roughly 10$\mu$m
