\subsection{Peak Calling}

To accurately identify pair of beads that interact more frequently than expected, we employ a peak calling procedure on the 5C probability data. We analyze TAD D and the region between TADs separately from TAD E to avoid peak bias. We average all encounter frequency signals, taken from all genomic distances, and smooth the resulting mean signal using loess smoothing technique to represent the expected background encounter signal,$E(d)$, and calculate its standard deviation $\sigma_E$. The background Z-score distribution is calculated using all data by $z_B=\frac{O_{i(d)}(d)-E(d)}{\sigma_E}$, for each $i(d)=1,..,N(d)$, with $N(d)$ the number of observations available for genomic distance $d$. A Weibull distribution is fitted to the background signal, where negative values $Z_B$ are discarded, since we are only interested in peak values. We then estimate the threshold value, $T_B$, above which z-scores are considered as global outliers of the data, as the 0.98 percent of this distribution. The value of $T_B$ will be used in judging observations in particular genomic distances for being peaks.

For each genomic distance $d$, we calculate a z-score for all available observations at that distance by $z({\{i\}_d})=\frac{O({\{i\}_d})-E(d)}{\sigma_{O}(d)}$ and fit a Weibull distribution to it, discarding negative z-scores. The Weibull CDF is used to calculate a rejection value $T_d$ above which observation at genomic distance $d$ are considered peaks. 

We estimate a new global rejection value based on the distribution of rejection values obtained for $d$ and the background, by calculating the $T = \frac{T_d-T_B}{\sigma_T}$ and fitting it with a Weibull distribution. We then threshold the data with $T_{global}$ as the 0.97 percent of the $T$ distribution. 

For each peak found after thresholding, we examine the peak strength in its neighborhood of 5, 10, and 15 genomoic distances and call it by a majority voting.
